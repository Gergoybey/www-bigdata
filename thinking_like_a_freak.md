> Another barrier to thinking like a Freak is that most people
> are to busy to rethink the way they think—or to even spend much
> time thinking at all. When was the last time you sat for
> an hour of pure, unadulterated thinking? If you’re like most
> people, it’s been a while. Is it simply a function of our
> high-speed era? Perhaps not.
> The absurdly talented George Bernard Shaw—a worls-class writer
> *and* a founder of the London School of Economics–noted this
> thought deficit many years ago. “Few people think more than
> two or three times a year.,” Shaw reportedly said. “I have made an
> international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.<br>
> — S. D. Levitt, S. J. Dubner, “Think Like a Freak”
